## NetBSD kernel Lua Test Suite

This is a port of Lua userspace test suite to NetBSD kernel Lua. 
Work on this began as a Google Summer of Code '15 project. Back 
then, kernel Lua was based on Lua 5.3.0; I'm now reworking the port, 
making improvements and porting the 5.3.2 test suite. Please check out 
the Wiki for more about the project and a quick tutorial on how to run 
the tests.

If you have any suggestions, please contact me on my email! : )
